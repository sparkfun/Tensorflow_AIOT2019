This repository contains examples that demonstrate the use of [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/) based machine learning executing on the [SparkFun Edge Development](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170) board. The examples are designed for use within the Arduino development environment, enabling rapid setup and deployment of the examples.

The examples contained in this repository make use of the variety of sensors available on the SparkFun Edge Development board to show the modern capabilities of machine learning executing on a low-power microcontroller-based system.

The following examples are included in the repository:
* micro_speech - Using the on-board microphone to detect a spoken keyword
* person_detection - Using an attached camera to detect the presence of a person in an image. 
* magic_wand - Using the on-board accelerometer to detect gestures (movement of the breakout board) 

Hardware
---------
To run the examples, the following hardware is required:
* [SparkFun Edge Development breakout board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170)
* [Himax CMOS Imaging Camera – HM01B0](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15570)
* [SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14050) or [SparkFun Serial Basic Breakout USB-C](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15096)
* [USB-A to micro-B cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10215) or a cable to connect the Serial Basic to the development computer.
